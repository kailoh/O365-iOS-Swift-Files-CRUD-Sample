# Office 365 iOS SDK
## Sample App written in Swift

This is the accompanying code sample to my step-by-step article on how to use the Office 365 SDK in iOS to create, read, update and delete files. It's very basic code that I slapped together in a very short amount of time to show you how easy it is to use the Office 365 iOS SDK in Swift.

Use however you wish. No attribution necessary.
