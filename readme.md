This is the accompanying code sample to my step-by-step article on how to use the Office 365 SDK in iOS to create, read, update and delete files. It's very basic code that I slapped together in a very short amount of time, and is meant to be a quick demo, nothing more.

Use however you wish. No attribution necessary.
